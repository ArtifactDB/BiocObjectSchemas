# Sequence information

## Overview

A sequence information object stored inside a CSV file, formatted as described in the [**comservatory** specification (version 1.0)](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/comservatory).
This corresponds to the [`sequence_information`](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/BiocObjectSchemas/raw/master/raw/sequence_information/v1.json) schema.
We use `~` below to denote properties of the schema.

Inside the CSV file, we expect columns in the following type and order:

- A string column named `seqnames`, containing the reference sequence (e.g., chromosome) name.
  All strings should be non-missing and unique.
- An integer column named `seqlengths`, containing the length of each reference sequence.
  All values should be non-negative and fit inside a 32-bit signed integer.
  Missing values are allowed.
- A boolean column named `isCircular`, specifying whether the reference sequence is circular.
  Missing values are allowed.
- A string column named `genome`, containing the genome of origin for each sequence.
  Missing values are allowed.

The number of rows should be equal to `~sequence_information.dimensions[0]`.
