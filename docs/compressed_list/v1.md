# Compressed list

## Overview

An abstract compressed list stored inside a CSV file, formatted as described in the [**comservatory** specification (version 1.0)](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/comservatory).
This corresponds to the [`compressed_list`](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/BiocObjectSchemas/raw/master/raw/compressed_list/v1.json) schema.
We use `~` below to denote properties of the schema.

Inside the CSV, we expect columns in the following type and order:

- (optional) A string column containing the name of each element.
  All strings should be non-missing.
  This column can have any name that not conflict with subsequent columns.
  It should only be present if `~compressed_list.names = true`.
- An integer column named `number`, containing the length of each entry of the list.
  All values must be non-negative, non-missing, and representable by a 32-bit signed integer.
  The sum of values should be equal to the total length of the concatenated object (see each subclass for the specific property).

The number of rows of the CSV should be equal to `~compressed_list.length`.
