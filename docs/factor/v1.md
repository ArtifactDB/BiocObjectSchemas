# Factor

## Overview

An abstract factor stored inside a CSV file, formatted as described in the [**comservatory** specification (version 1.0)](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/comservatory).
This corresponds to the [`factor`](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/BiocObjectSchemas/raw/master/raw/factor/v1.json) schema.
We use `~` below to denote properties of the schema.

In ths CSV, we expect columns in the following type and order:

- (optional) A string column containing the name of each element.
  All strings should be non-missing.
  This column can have any name that not conflict with subsequent columns.
  It should only be present if and only if `~factor.names = true`.
- An integer column named `values`, containing the codes for the factor.
  Each code is a 0-based index into an array of factor levels.
  Missing values are allowed.
  All (non-missing) values must be non-negative, less than the total number of levels, and representable by a 32-bit signed integer.
  (The total number of levels is referenced in subclass-specific properties.)

The number of rows should be equal to `~factor.length`.
