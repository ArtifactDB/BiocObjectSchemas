    "description": "A bumpy matrix of data frames, corresponding to the BumpyDataFrameMatrix class from the [**BumpyMatrix**](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/BumpyMatrix) package. Each entry of the matrix contains a data frame with a variable number of rows but the same columns. A concatenated data frame is created by row-wise combining all individual data frames and is referenced by the `concatenated` property.\n\nDerived from `bumpy_matrix/v1.json`: a virtual \"bumpy\" matrix of vector-like objects of the same type, corresponding to the BumpyMatrix class from the [BumpyMatrix](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/BumpyMatrix) package. Each entry of the matrix contains a vector-like object with a variable number of subelements.For efficient storage, all matrix elements are concatenated into a single object of the same type, with length equal to the total number of subelements across all vector-like objects.\n\n To reconstitute the bumpy matrix, we can inspect the partitioning information in the data frame, which is saved to `path` as a CSV file under the [**comservatory**](https://artifactdb.github.io/comservatory) specification (version 1). Each row of the data frame corresponds to an vector-like object in the bumpy matrix. The columns `row`, `column` and `number` are present in this data frame, specifying the 1-based row index, 1-based column index and length of the vector-like object. Subelements of the concatenated object are partitioned by assigning the specified `number` of consecutive subelements into a series of contiguous vector-like objects, each of which correspond to successive rows in the data frame.Matrix entries not listed in the data frame are assumed to be length-0 vector-like objects of the same type.\n\n If row or column names are present on the bumpy matrix, they are in separate files.These child objects should be referenced by the `bumpy_matrix.row_names` and `bumpy_matrix.column_names` properties.\n\n Concrete subclasses are expected to provide a `concatenated` property that points to the concatenated object.\n\nDerived from `array/v1.json`: some kind of multi-dimensional array, where we store metadata about the dimensions and type of data. The exact implementation of the array is left to concrete subclasses.",
