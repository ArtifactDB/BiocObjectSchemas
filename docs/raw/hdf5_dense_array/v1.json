For the `array.dimensions` property, the fastest-changing dimension is the \"first\" dimension while the slowest-changing is the \"last\" dimension. (Note that this is reversed in dimensions reported by the HDF5 dataset itself, where the dimensions are listed from slowest to fastest.) In the context of assay matrices, the fastest-changing dimension usually corresponds to features while the second-fastest dimension represents the samples. The file may also contain the dimnames of the array.\n\nDerived from `array/v1.json`: some kind of multi-dimensional array, where we store metadata about the dimensions and type of data. The exact implementation of the array is left to concrete subclasses.",
