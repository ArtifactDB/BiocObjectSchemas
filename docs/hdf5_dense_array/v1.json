    "description": "Dense array, saved in a HDF5 file as an N-dimensional dataset for positive N.\n\nFor the `array.dimensions` property, the first dimension is assumed to be the fastest-changing while the last dimension is assumed to be slowest. In the context of matrices, this implies a column-major layout where the first (faster) dimension corresponds to the rows and the second (slower) dimension corresponds to the columns. Note that this ordering is reversed in the dimensions of the HDF5 dataset, which are always listed from slowest to fastest - as such, an implicit transposition is necessary when reading from or writing to file.\n\nThe file may also contain the dimnames of the array, stored in a separate HDF5 group. If present, the name of the group should be listed in the `hdf5_dense_array.dimnames` property.\n\nFor a signed integer dataset, missing values are represented by -2147483648.\n\nA string dataset may contain a `missing` attribute. This should be a scalar string dataset that contains the string used to represent missing values. If no attribute exists, it is assumed that all strings are non-missing.\n\nDerived from `array/v1.json`: some kind of multi-dimensional array, where we store metadata about the dimensions and type of data. The exact implementation of the array is left to concrete subclasses.",
