    "description": "Dense array, saved in a HDF5 file as an N-dimensional dataset for positive N.\n\nThe dimensions reported in `array.dimensions` are be ordered from fastest-changing to slowest, i.e., the first entry of the `array.dimensions` property corresponds to the fastest-changing dimension. In the context of matrices, this implies a column-major layout where the first (faster) dimension corresponds to the rows and the second (slower) dimension corresponds to the columns. Note that this ordering is reversed in the dimensions of the HDF5 dataset, as the HDF5 library lists the dimensions from slowest-changing to fastest.\n\nThe file may also contain the dimnames of the array, stored in a separate HDF5 group. If present, the name of the group should be listed in the `hdf5_dense_array.dimnames` property.\n\nBoolean arrays are stored as integer HDF5 datasets, where a value of 1 is truthy and a value of zero is falsey. These can be distinguished from integer columns by inspecting the `array.type` property.\n\nInteger arrays can be represented by any integer HDF5 datatype at the discretion of the data generator. However, it is advisable to use a data type that is representable by a 32-bit signed integer, for maximum compatibility with downstream clients.\n\nFor an array stored as an integer HDF5 dataset, missing values are represented by -2147483648.\n\nA string dataset may contain a `missing-value-placeholder` attribute. This should be a scalar string dataset that contains the string used to represent missing values. If no attribute exists, it is assumed that all strings are non-missing.\n\nDerived from `array/v1.json`: some kind of multi-dimensional array, where we store metadata about the dimensions and type of data. The exact implementation of the array is left to concrete subclasses.",
