    "description": "Dense array, saved in a HDF5 file as an n-dimensional dataset. For the `array.dimensions` property, the fastest-changing dimension is the \"first\" dimension while the slowest-changing is the \"last\" dimension. (Note that this is reversed in dimensions reported by the HDF5 dataset itself, where the dimensions are listed from slowest to fastest.) In the context of matrices, the fastest-changing dimension corresponds to the rows and the slowest-changing dimension corresponds to the columns. The file may also contain the dimnames of the array.\n\nFor a signed integer dataset, missing values are represented by -2147483648.\n\nA string dataset may contain a `missing` attribute. This should be a scalar string dataset that contains the string used to represent missing values. If no attribute exists, it is assumed that all strings are non-missing.\n\nDerived from `array/v1.json`: some kind of multi-dimensional array, where we store metadata about the dimensions and type of data. The exact implementation of the array is left to concrete subclasses.",
