# Atomic vector

## Overview

An atomic vector stored inside a CSV file, formatted as described in the [**comservatory** specification (version 1.0)](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/comservatory).
This corresponds to the [`atomic_vector`](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/BiocObjectSchemas/raw/master/raw/atomic_vector/v1.json) schema.
We use `~` below to denote properties of the schema.

Inside the CSV file, we expect columns in the following type and order:

- (optional) A string column containing the name of each element.
  All strings should be non-missing.
  This column can have any name that not conflict with subsequent columns.
  It should be present if and only if `~atomic_vector.names = true`.
- A column named `values`, containing the contents of the atomic vector.
  This can be a string, integer, number or boolean column, depending on `~atomic_vector.type`, and may contain missing values.
  For integer columns, all (non-missing) values must be representable by a 32-bit signed integer.
