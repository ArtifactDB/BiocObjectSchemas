In the context of matrices, this implies a column-major layout where the first (faster) dimension corresponds to the rows and the second (slower) dimension corresponds to the columns. Note that this ordering is reversed in the dimensions of the HDF5 dataset, as the HDF5 library lists the dimensions from slowest-changing to fastest.\n\nThe file may also contain the dimnames of the array, stored in a separate HDF5 group. If present, the name of the group should be listed in the `hdf5_dense_array.dimnames` property.\n\nFor a signed integer dataset, missing values are represented by -2147483648.\n\nA string dataset may contain a `missing` attribute. This should be a scalar string dataset that contains the string used to represent missing values. If no attribute exists, it is assumed that all strings are non-missing.",
