    "description": "A virtual \"bumpy\" matrix of vector-like objects of the same type, corresponding to the BumpyMatrix class from the [BumpyMatrix](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/BumpyMatrix) package. Each entry of the matrix contains a vector-like object with a variable number of subelements. For efficient storage, all matrix elements are concatenated into a single object of the same type, with length equal to the total number of subelements across all vector-like objects.\n\nTo recover the bumpy matrix, we can inspect the partitioning information in the data frame, which is saved to `path` as a CSV file under the [**comservatory**](https://ltla.github.io/comservatory) specification. Each row of the data frame corresponds to an vector-like object in the bumpy matrix. The columns `row`, `column` and `number` are present in this data frame, specifying the 1-based row index, 1-based column index and length of the vector-like object. Subelements of the concatenated object are partitioned by assigning the specified `number` of consecutive subelements into a series of contiguous vector-like objects, each of which correspond to successive rows in the data frame. Matrix entries not listed in the data frame are assumed to be length-0 vector-like objects of the same type.\n\nOptionally, matrix dimnames are stored as separate data frames and referenced by `row_names` and `column_names`.\n\nConcrete subclasses are expected to provide a `concatenated` property that points to the concatenated object.",
