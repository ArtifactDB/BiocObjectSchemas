This is typically used to combine data from different samples or conditions into a single array, e.g., to store in a consolidated SummarizedExperiment object. The key feature of this schema is that the individual component matrices are still represented by separate files; this means that it can be very cheap to add or remove components by just modifying the metadata rather than making a new copy of the entire dataset.",
