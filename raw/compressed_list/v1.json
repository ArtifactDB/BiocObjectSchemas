    "description": "A virtual compressed list where all elements are vector-like objects of the same type, corresponding to the CompressedList class from the [**IRanges**](https://bioconductor.org/packages/IRanges) Bioconductor package. Each list element contains a vector-like object with a variable number of subelements, which can be concatenated into a single vector-like object of the same type with length equal to the sum of the individual element lengths. The use of a concatenated object improves storage efficiency as list elements can be compressed into a single file.\n\nThe partitioning of the concatenated object into individual list elements is described in a data frame, saved to `path` as a CSV file using the [**comservatory**](https://ltla.github.io/comservatory) specification. This data frame contains one row per list element, along with a `number` column that specifies the size of each vector-like object. Subelements are partitioned by assigning the specified `number` of consecutive subelements into a contiguous series of vector-like objects, each of which correspond to successive list elements. If the `names` property is `true`, the first column of the data frame contains the names of the list elements.\n\nConcrete subclasses are expected to provide a `concatenated` property that points to the concatenated object.",
