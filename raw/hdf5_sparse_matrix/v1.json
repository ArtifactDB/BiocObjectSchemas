        "Sparse matrix, saved in compressed sparse format inside a group of a HDF5 file.",
        "The HDF5 group should contain the typical contents of the compressed sparse matrix, i.e., `indices`, `indptr` and `data`.",
        "Specifically, `data` should be a 1-dimensional integer or numeric dataset containing the values of the non-zero elements;",
        "`indices` should be a 1-dimensional integer dataset containing the 0-based row/column index for each non-zero element in `data`;",
        "and `indptr` should be a 1-dimensional integer dataset of length equal to the number of columns/rows plus 1, containing pointers to the start and end of each column/row.",
        "The exact interpretation of these datasets depends on the format specified in `format`.\n\n",
        "The `array.dimensions` property should have exactly two elements.",
        "The first entry should be the number of rows, while the second entry should be the number of columns.\n\n",
        "Dimnames may also be saved inside the same HDF5 file, as string datasets in another group.",
        "In such cases, the `hdf5_sparse_matrix.dimnames` property should be present and contain the name of that group.\n\n",
        "Boolean `data` are stored as integer HDF5 datasets, where a value of 1 is truthy and a value of zero is falsey.",
        "These can be distinguished from integer columns by inspecting the `array.type` property.\n\n",
        "Integer `data` can be represented by any integer HDF5 datatype at the discretion of the data generator.",
        "However, it is advisable to use a data type that is representable by a 32-bit signed integer, for maximum compatibility with downstream clients.\n\n",
        "The `data` dataset may have a `missing-value-placeholder` attribute, containing a scalar value of the same type.",
        "Any value equal to this placeholder should be treated as missing.",
        "If no attribute exists, it can be assumed that no values are missing.",
        "(In `hdf5_sparse_matrix.version = 1`, no placeholder was present; missing integers and booleans were represented by -2147483648 instead.)"
