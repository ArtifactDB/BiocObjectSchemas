    "description": "A data frame object stored inside a group of a_HDF5 file. Simple columns are stored as one-dimensional datasets in the `data` subgroup, named by their positional 0-based index in the data frame. All such datasets should have the same length. Column names are stored in `column_names`, a 1-dimensional string dataset of length equal to the number of columns. Row names, if present, are stored in a `row_names` dataset. For complex columns, the corresponding dataset is omitted and the actual contents are obtained from other files; a pointer to the resource should be stored in the corresponding entry of the `data_frame.columns` property.\n\nBoolean columns are stored as integer HDF5 datasets, where a value of 1 is truthy and a value of zero is falsey. These can be distinguished from integer columns by inspecting the `data_frame.columns.type` property.\n\nInteger columns can be represented by any integer HDF5 datatype at the discretion of the data generator. However, it is advisable to use a data type that is representable by a 32-bit signed integer, for maximum compatibility with downstream clients.\n\nFor any column represented by an integer dataset (including boolean columns), missing values are represented by -2147483648.\n\nFor any column represented by a string dataset, that dataset may contain a `missing-value-placeholder` attribute. This should be a scalar string dataset that contains the string used to represent missing values. If no attribute exists, it is assumed that all strings are non-missing. Note that the `row_names` dataset, if present, should not contain any missing values.",
